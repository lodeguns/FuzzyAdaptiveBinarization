### Abstract
**Background:**  	 
Adaptive binarization methodologies thredhold the intensity of the pixels with respect to adjacent pixels exploiting the integral images. In turn, the integral images are generally computed optimally using the summed-area-table algorithm (SAT).                                 
**Results:**   
This document presents a new adaptive binarization technique based on fuzzy integral images through an efficient design of a modified SAT for fuzzy integrals. We define this new methodology as FLAT (Fuzzy Local Adaptive Thresholding). Furthermore, a new definition of generalized high performance fuzzy integral is provided. 		
                                
 **Conclusions:** 
 The experimental results show that the proposed methodology have produced an image quality thresholding often better than other traditional or simple neural network models. Furthermore, this new methodology is also competitive in terms of performance over time. Therefore, these new generalized fuzzy integrals (based on generalized form of Sugeno, Choquet and Hamacher t-Norm) can be used as a tool for grayscale processing in real-time and deep-learning applications.
