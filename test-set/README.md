## Toy dataset, Test dataset and an additional theta-dataset for thresholding
The respective datasets are: [toy dataset](gamma-dataset),  [test dataset 280](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11lIv91rRgYFbADVPptOsLnEu2zJDCCnJ?usp=sharing) of 280 images for testing our algorithms at the optimum, and [test_dataset 2413](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15OezFUWvfXpYI3Tx8gqneC8_ETND8CdJ) for testing our and other thresholding algorithms with a bigger benchmark (2413 images).

The toy dataset is our challenging dataset with controlled perturbations, while the 2 test datasets are provided by an [external source](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/DSS), please refeer to citations in the paper for more details.
